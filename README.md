# TWO EVENTS WHICH MARK THE CLOSE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
When the sun disappeared on the last day of the Nineteenth
Century, it left in the horizon vivid pictures of two unexpected and
incomplete events, whose influences will penetrate far into the
realm of future history and throw light upon the great records
which will be made in this new century. In one picture, the United
States of America was seen fighting in the Philippines for the
possession of a land which she claimed by the double title of
conquest and purchase. In the other, the British Empire was
battling with the Boers; sending her armies over the seas into
Africa, to answer the defiant and goading challenge of that people.
Strange and unexpected history! The two powers the least prepared
for or anticipating war were forced into battle; while Germany,
France, Austria, and Italy, armed to the teeth, momentarily
expecting strife, became spectators instead of actors. We must
prepare always for the unexpected.
Neither the acquisition by the United States of new territories,
conquered or purchased, from a weaker power, nor the subjugation
of the Boers by England and the enforcement of absolute
sovereignty upon their republics, are, per se, events of supreme
importance to the outside world.
The continental powers view with comparative complacency the
relinquishment of the sovereignty of Spain over the Philippines, 
Cuba, and Puerto Rico; and while the subjugation of the Boers, and
the metamorphosis of their republics into colonies of the British
Empire, awakens keener interest and criticism, these acts will,
nevertheless, pass unchallenged, and eventually be acquiesced in.
But the deep significance of these two historical incidents is, that
they have brought the English-American peoples into such striking
prominence that their present and future relations to each other,
and the aim and scope of their ambition, separately or combined,
must become an absorbing topic of international thought and
discussion.
A union of all the English-speaking peoples has become a
probability; and while the question, in the ordinary course of
events, must pass through the crucible of debate, tinctured and
embittered by prejudice, ignorance, and jealousy, a sudden
upheaval or unexpected revolution in international affairs might
cause its solution in a day. On the other hand, it may drag along
through years, the {3} sport of every whirlwind of domestic and
foreign politics.
The Anglo-Saxon people should only be concerned with the right
and wrong of the subject—absolutely fearless of the results to
which an inquiry based upon sound premises may lead. It is now
manifest that to this great race is entrusted the civilisation and
christianisation of the world.
Whether they will perform the duties of this sacred trust is the
problem of the Twentieth Century.
I shall proceed to state the grounds for this opinion, and to unfold
the reasons which should influence this great people to act as one.
# BY THE SPANISH WAR, THE RELATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES TO EUROPE AND THE EAST WERE SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED
This war reveals the United States in many aspects as the leading
power of the world. While her wonderful development, progress,
and marvellous wealth were freely talked about and ungrudgingly
acknowledged, she has, by this last war, leaped, per saltum, into a
position among nations which will force her, nolens volens, to
assume all the burdens and responsibilities which her new rank
demands. If we look the actual situation in the face, it is impossible
to escape the consequences of this dénouement. The United States
has suddenly become a natural and necessary party to all great
international questions; and this fact, with her increasing
commercial and financial power, demands {4} that she should be
ready to second the interests of her people, who are now spreading
out in all directions in search of greater wealth and wider business
relations. The oceans which separate the United States from
Europe and the East were once supposed to be perpetual barriers to
her active participation in international questions. It was assumed
that she had quite enough to do, then and for all time to come, to
attend to the development of her own vast and continuous country.
The victory of Dewey at Manila, however, combined with the
mighty change which has been wrought in human affairs by
science, electricity, and steam, struck the scales from the eyes of
the world, and, presto! she has leaped into the arena of history as
the most important factor of the new century. Can this situation be
made other than it is by the shibboleth of party platforms, or
individual opinion? Can her progress be stayed? With as much
reason we may command the flowers and the trees not to grow—
bid nature stand still, and her laws not operate!
She did not seek the rank of an international power; it was evolved
out of a confluence of natural conditions. She can no more cast it
off than can our bodies the food of which we have partaken after it
has entered into our organisms. If history teaches any lesson, it is
that nations, like individuals, follow the law of their being; that in
their growth and in their decline they are creatures of conditions, in 
which even their own volition plays but a part, and that often the
smallest part.
